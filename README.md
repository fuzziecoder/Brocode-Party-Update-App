## 🔑 Key Concepts

### Spots
A "Spot" represents a party, event, or gathering location. Users can:
- Create spots (become admin)
- Join existing spots via code
- Browse and order items within a spot

### Ordering Flow
1. User joins/creates a spot
2. Browse available drinks, food, cigarettes
3. Add items to order
4. View personal bill
5. Admin can see master bill with all orders
6. Mark payments as complete

### User Roles
- **Admin** - Spot creator with full management access
- **User** - Regular participant who can order and view their bill
